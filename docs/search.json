Using a REDD+ project funded by USAID in Eastern Zambia, I investigate the impact of community compensation on environmental outcomes. By analyzing Chiefdom and household data, I explore how forest dependence and social norms influence conservation performance. The protected area boundaries were established with local authorities, potentially leading to strategic site selection. Leveraging geospatial and household data, I assess whether communities strategically selected low-pressure areas for protection. My findings show no reduction in deforestation within protected areas but suggest negative spillover effects in non-protected areas. Non-protected areas increase tree cover loss after the policy, which lead to overall deforestation rates increased in treated chiefdoms post-policy. This research highlights the need to account for incentives and strategic behavior when designing effective conservation policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional figures\n\n\nZambia Province tree cover in 2000\n\n\n\nEastern region tree cover loss (2001 - 2023)"

This study evaluates the environmental impacts of a REDD+ project funded by USAID in Eastern Zambia, which established protected areas within contracted chiefdom boundaries in partnership with local authorities. Leveraging geospatial and household data, I analyze whether communities strategically designated areas with low deforestation pressure for protection and assess the program‚Äôs conservation outcomes. Furthermore, I examine spillover effects on non-protected areas within contracted chiefdoms. The results indicate that the program successfully reduced deforestation within protected areas. However, tree cover loss in creased in non-protected areas, leading to negative spillovers that more than offset the conservation gains. Consequently, treated chiefdoms experienced higher overall deforestation rates post-policy. These findings highlight the importance of addressing strategic behavior and incentive structures in the design of conservation policies to ensure their long-term effectiveness\n\n\n\nWorking Papers\n\nPopulation burdens of air pollution around the world: Distributions, inequalities, and links to per capita GDP\nDraft\nPoster - Best Poster award PAA 2024\n\n\n \n\nWe analyze the global population-weighted distribution of air pollution by aerosols and its relationship to GDP per capita. We first decompose the global distribution and consider both variations across and within regions and countries. Second, we map national and subnational distributions of air pollution by aerosols to national and subnational distributions of GDP per capita. We find considerable global exposure inequalities. Comparing continents at the extremes, the average individual in Asia is 3.32 times more exposed to air pollution by aerosols than the average individual in Oceania. In Africa and Asia, populations at the 80percentile of the air pollution by aerosol distribution are 141% and 109% more exposed than population at the 20percentile, and those at the 90percentile are 227% and 185% more exposed those at the 10percentile. Globally, we find that a doubling of GDP per capita is associated with a 11.8 percentage points reduction in the percentage deviation between a subnational unit‚Äôs population-weighted air pollution by aerosol level and the global population-weighted mean. Within each continent, exploiting variabilities in subnational data after controlling for aggregate regional variabilities, we find positive associations between air pollution by aerosols and GDP per capita in Africa and Europe, but negative associations in the Americas, Asia, and Oceania.\n\n\nExtreme Heat and Air Pollution Risks for Early Childhood Development in Latin America and the Caribbean\nDraft Soon\n\n\n\n \n\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is characterized by high and unequal exposure to climatic and environmental hazards, with children under five being particularly vulnerable. Specifically, exposure to air pollution and extreme heat can exacerbate health risks: sudden temperature increases can lead to heat stroke, dehydration, and even death, while warmer temperatures heighten the transmission of vector-borne diseases. Extreme temperatures can also reduce food production quality and quantity, contributing to malnutrition. Air pollution is linked to thousands of child deaths annually and to a range of non-communicable diseases (e.g., asthma, cancer, neurodevelopmental and mental health disorders), which disproportionately affect poorer households and often have long-term effects. Exposure to poor air quality and rising temperatures can also deepen poverty, exacerbate inequalities, and have intergenerational impacts, potentially increasing conflicts over time. This report addresses the significant challenges faced by LAC due to extreme heat and air pollution exposure on early childhood development (in utero to age 5). First, it introduces a framework for understanding how exposure can impact various dimensions of early childhood development, such as birth outcomes, mental health, physical health, cognitive development, and physical growth. These effects are likely to interact dynamically over a child‚Äôs lifecycle, affecting development stages in early life and beyond age five, within an ecological framework that includes families, communities, services, and infrastructure, which may mediate or intensify these impacts. Second, by considering the spatial distribution of the child population, air pollution (PM 2.5), temperature (UTCI), and economic vulnerabilities in LAC, the report provides measures and rankings of climatic and pollution burdens for children across economies in the region. Finally, it presents evidence on the effects of climatic and pollution risks on child development under age five and concludes with policy recommendations for LAC."
