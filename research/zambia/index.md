Conservation area policies are crucial for preserving natural resources. Using a REDD+ project funded by USAID in Eastern Zambia, I investigate the impact of community compensation on environmental outcomes. By analyzing Chiefdom and household data, I explore how forest dependence and social norms influence conservation performance. The protected area boundaries were established with local authorities, potentially leading to strategic site selection. Leveraging geospatial and household data, I assess whether communities strategically selected low-pressure areas for protection. My findings show no reduction in deforestation within protected areas but suggest negative spillover effects in non-protected areas. Non-protected areas increase tree cover loss after the policy, which lead to overall deforestation rates increased in treated chiefdoms post-policy. This research highlights the need to account for incentives and strategic behavior when designing effective conservation policies.
