        "Conservation policies are critical for preserving natural resources, yet their effectiveness can be influenced by strategic site selection and unintended consequences. This study evaluates the environmental impacts of a REDD+ project funded by USAID in Eastern Zambia, which established protected areas within contracted chiefdom boundaries in partnership with local authorities. Leveraging geospatial and household data, I analyze whether communities strategically designated areas with low deforestation pressure for protection and assess the programâ€™s conservation outcomes. Furthermore, I examine spillover effects on non-protected areas within contracted chiefdoms. The results indicate that the program successfully reduced deforestation within protected areas. However, tree cover loss in creased in non-protected areas, leading to negative spillovers that more than offset the conservation gains. Consequently, treated chiefdoms experienced higher overall deforestation rates post-policy. These findings highlight the importance of addressing strategic behavior and incentive structures in the design of conservation policies to ensure their long-term effectiveness\n",
